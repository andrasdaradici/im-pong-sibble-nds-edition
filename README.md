# Im-Pong-Sibble - NDS Edition

Pong, but the AI is impossible to beat!

Two modes are available:
- Single-player 
  - Play against the unbeatable AI
- Two-player
  - Play locally with a friend on the same console

Im-Pong-Sibble ported to the NDS using the libnds and gl2d library using the C programming language.
